## [6.3.1](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-kibana/tree/6.3.1) (2018-10-19)

#### Fixes
* This module no longer requires or enforces a version of the puppetlabs/apt module, which is transitively handled through the `elastic/elastic_stack` dependency.
* Permit hashes to be passed as configuration parameter values.

## 6.3.0 (June 18, 2018)

This release deprecates Kibana 4.x, which is end-of-life.

### Migration Guide

* Support for 4.x has been deprecated, so consider upgrading to Kibana 5 or later before upgrading this module since only versions 5 and later are supported.
* The module defaults to the upstream package repositories, which now include X-Pack bundled by default. To preserve previous behavior which does _not_ include X-Pack, follow the `README` instructions to configure `oss`-only repositories/packages.
* Use of the `elastic_stack::repo` class for managing package repositories may mean that leftover yum/apt/etc. repositories named `kibana` may persist after upgrade.

#### Features
* Support for 6.3 style repositories using elastic_stack module

#### Fixes

## 6.0.1 (March 13, 2018)

#### Fixes
* Fixed language compatibility errors that could arise when using JRuby 1.7 on Puppet Servers.

## 6.0.0 (November 14, 2017)

Major version upgrade with important deprecations:

* Puppet version 3 is no longer supported.

The following migration guide is intended to help aid in upgrading this module.

### Migration Guide

#### Puppet 3.x No Longer Supported

Puppet 4.5.0 is the new minimum required version of Puppet, which offers better safety, module metadata, and Ruby features.
Migrating from Puppet 3 to Puppet 4 is beyond the scope of this guide, but the [official upgrade documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/upgrade/upgrade_steps.html) can help.
As with any version or module upgrade, remember to restart any agents and master servers as needed.

## 5.1.0 (August 18, 2017)
